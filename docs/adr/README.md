# Architecture Decision Records

This document consolidates converter-side architectural decisions for
svg2ooxml. Individual ADR files have been archived — this is the single source
of truth for the converter repo.

Empirical PowerPoint research, oracle-corpus ownership, and PPTX lab tooling
decisions now live in the sibling `openxml-audit` repo. This repo owns SVG
parse -> IR -> DrawingML/PresentationML emission -> PPTX packaging decisions.

---

## Core Pipeline

### Parser Decomposition
Break the monolithic parser into focused modules: dom_loader, normalization,
style_context, reference_collector. Services injected via `configure_services()`
to avoid global state mutation.

### Geometry & IR
Typed intermediate representation: `IRScene`, shapes, text, paint, effects.
Geometry stack handles paths, clip regions, and optional NumPy acceleration.
All IR nodes are frozen dataclasses.

### Units, ViewBox, Transforms
Centralized `UnitConverter` with fluent API and EMU constants. `ViewportEngine`
handles meet-or-slice logic. Transform utilities provide decomposition and
fractional EMU math. Eliminates ad-hoc coordinate conversions.

### Policy, Services, Mapping
`PolicyEngine` with pluggable providers by domain (image, text, geometry, mask,
filter). `ConversionServices` registry with dependency injection. Mapper ABC
defines element traversal pattern (path, image, text mappers).

### Batch Integration
Parser/preprocess pipeline for job payloads. Huey task integration for
background processing. Services injected via `configure_services()`.

## Rendering & Output

### Resvg Rendering Strategy
Three-tier rendering ladder: native DrawingML → resvg promotion → legacy raster.
Resvg filters/masks/clips executed via filter planner; output packaged as PNG or
promoted to EMF/vector. Strategy toggles exposed via exporter config and env vars.

### DrawingML Writer
Writer emits `DrawingMLRenderResult` with asset registry (fonts, media,
diagnostics). Exporter consumes registry for slide/relationship/content-type
generation. Separates shape assembly from PPTX packaging.

### EMF Procedural Fallbacks
Hybrid EMF containers for procedural effects (turbulence, lighting) combining
vector instructions with embedded bitmap tiles. Routing: native DrawingML →
mimicked DrawingML → hybrid EMF → PNG fallback.

### Font Embedding (EOT)
EOT-based pipeline converts subset OpenType fonts for PPTX packaging.
`PPTXPackageBuilder` writes .fntdata parts with proper relationships.
FontForge optional with graceful degradation.

### Text & WordArt
Multi-strategy text handling: native text, EMF fallback, WordArt presets,
outline conversion. Font discovery via `FontService`/`FontEmbeddingEngine`.
Deterministic curve positioning for WordArt classification.

### Color Engine
Fluent `Color` API with OKLab/OKLCh operations, harmony helpers, accessibility
checks. Bridges with lightweight Color model for backward compatibility.
Enables gradient palette optimization and raster normalization.

### Filter System
`FilterContext`/`FilterResult`/abstract `Filter` with registry and pipeline
dispatcher. Primitives: blur, shadow, glow, soft-edge, color matrix,
displacement, blend/composite, lighting, turbulence. Emits DrawingML effects
with rasterization hooks.

### EffectDag & Color Transforms
Dual native-effect architecture: `effectLst` for simple DrawingML effects,
`effectDag` for compositing/mask graphs needing alpha operators. Context-aware
color-transform emission. Policy-gated rollout.

## Animation

Start with `docs/internals/animation-documentation-map.md` for the current
split between converter specs, execution ledgers, emitted SSOTs, and
research-owned material in `openxml-audit`.

This section records durable animation decisions only. Program framing,
acceptance criteria, and cleanup mechanics live in the specs.

### SMIL Animation Support
SMIL/animated attribute sampler, timing engine, and multi-slide orchestrator.
IR animation types, SMIL parser, timeline sampler with interpolation. Native
timing XML writer with policy-driven fallbacks for easing/motion paths.

### Animation Writer Rewrite (ADR-020, completed)
All handlers return lxml elements; single `to_string()` at serialization
boundary. Fixed ID allocation, added click group wrapper, centralized unit
conversion. Implemented event-based begin triggers, paced calcMode,
additive/accumulate attributes, multi-keyframe translate, matrix decomposition.

### SMIL Parity & W3C Gating
Prioritizes SMIL semantic parity (begin triggers, mpath resolution, motion
rotation). Animation-focused W3C execution profiles as release gates.
Per-fragment degrade/omit behavior instead of timing suppression.

### Multi-Keyframe & Orbital Rotation
Multi-keyframe rotate (e.g., 0→360→0) splits into sequential `<p:animRot>`
segments. Rotation with cx/cy center emits companion `<p:animMotion>` orbital
arc. stroke-dashoffset animation maps to Wipe entrance effect. SMIL
min/max/restart/accumulate parsed and applied.

### Four-Layer Animation Fallback Architecture (ADR-031)

Animations that PowerPoint cannot express with one stable native primitive use
an ordered fallback ladder:

1. preset-backed native slots for stable authored families
2. a compound slot for stacking behaviour fragments in one executable group
3. flipbook playback for dead-path or sampled cases
4. Morph transitions for sole-animation geometry interpolation

Durable invariants:

- PowerPoint executes the `childTnLst` behaviour children directly, so preset
  metadata is a UI concern, not the runtime contract.
- Fallback choice is ordered by editability and structural stability:
  oracle-native -> compound -> flipbook -> morph.

The mapping taxonomy, evidence model, and current coverage live in:

- `docs/specs/svg-animation-native-mapping-spec.md`
- `docs/specs/animation-cleanup-rigour-spec.md`
- `docs/internals/animation-documentation-map.md`

### Large-File Refactor (ADR-032, completed)

All 11 Python files over 1000 lines split into sub-modules per
`docs/specs/refactor-large-files.md`. Pure moves, no behaviour changes.
One file per commit, 2412 tests green throughout.

| File | Before | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `core/pptx_exporter.py` | 2823 | 662 |
| `filters/renderer.py` | 1756 | 622 |
| `drawingml/raster_adapter.py` | 1557 | 1058 |
| `core/ir/text_converter.py` | 1309 | 778 |
| `elements/pattern_processor.py` | 1248 | 655 |

| `core/traversal/hooks.py` | 1033 | 342 |
| `core/animation/parser.py` | 1032 | 612 |

Shared infrastructure extracted to base classes (`_simple_oracle_gate`,
`_build_discrete_set_sequence` in `AnimationHandler`). New sub-packages:
`core/export/`, `core/ir/text/`, `core/ir/shape/`, `core/styling/paint/`,
`elements/patterns/`, `filters/strategies/`, `drawingml/pipelines/`.

### Research / Converter Boundary (ADR-033)

The April 2026 animation push produced two different kinds of system:

1. converter logic that decides what XML to emit
2. empirical tooling that discovers which PowerPoint-authored XML shapes
   actually load, roundtrip, and play

Keeping both in one repo made the ownership blurry. Scratch decks, capture
artifacts, extractor scripts, and oracle notes started to look like product
assets even when they were really research evidence.

Decision:

- `svg2ooxml` owns conversion behavior: SMIL semantics, fallback policy,
  `NativeFragment`/template composition, handler gates, emitted asset SSOT,
  packaging, and release criteria.
- `openxml-audit` owns empirical PPTX infrastructure: oracle corpus,
  extraction/snapshot/diff lab tooling, timing probe decks, and research ADRs.
- `svg2ooxml` may keep thin compatibility bridges for developer ergonomics, but
  the canonical implementation and durable research docs live in
  `openxml-audit`.
- Converter-side claims that depend on PowerPoint behavior should point to
  evidence in `openxml-audit/docs/pptx_oracle/` or the `openxml-audit` ADRs,
  not to scratch decks or ad hoc notes.

Consequences:

- large temporary decks, captures, and render artifacts do not belong in the
  converter repo
- the converter keeps emitted-side SSOTs such as
  `src/svg2ooxml/assets/animation_oracle/`, because they are part of runtime
  behavior, not empirical corpus ownership
- research can evolve independently without forcing the converter repo to carry
  every probe artifact and lab concern
- when a new empirical finding matters to emission, it lands in
  `openxml-audit` first and is then consumed here as evidence-backed policy or
  template work

### App / Converter Boundary (ADR-034)

The same repository currently contains `figma2gslides`, a tool built on top of
the converter. It may ship from the same repository, but its public contract is
different from the core `svg2ooxml` conversion library.

Decision:

- `svg2ooxml` owns converter code, converter docs, and the converter-facing
  `svg2ooxml` CLI
- `figma2gslides` owns the higher-level tool surface that consumes the
  converter: app runtime, auth, hosting, plugin assets, legal pages, and
  app-local operational tooling
- app-owned materials live under `src/figma2gslides/` and
  `apps/figma2gslides/`
- root `cli/` remains converter-facing unless an entrypoint is deliberately
  declared as a tool built on the converter
- shipping `figma2gslides` in the same distribution must be deliberate,
  documented, and tested as a top-level tool, not accidental package bleed from
  broad discovery settings

Consequences:

- new Google auth, Firebase, hosting, or plugin UX work should land in the app
  surface, while shared conversion fixes stay in `svg2ooxml`
- converter docs may link to the app/tool surface, but should not absorb app
  operational detail unless it affects converter behavior
- package contents and public imports must make the library/tool distinction
  explicit

### Next Hardening Targets (ADR-035)

Status: accepted for the post-0.7.3 cleanup stream.

Context:

The April 2026 review passes were productive because they focused on complete
end-to-end seams instead of isolated files. They found real defects in URL
handling, relationship IDs, package paths, raw DrawingML fragment ingestion,
font/image loading, unit conversion drift, and oversized modules. The next
passes should keep that seam-based approach, but they need an explicit order so
we do not keep chasing whichever large file is most visible.

Decision:

Prioritize targets by public blast radius first, then data-boundary risk, then
visual-fidelity impact, then maintainability drag.

Target order:

1. **Published package and public surface boundary**

   Why: ADR-034 says `figma2gslides` is a tool on top of the converter, not the
   core converter API. The `0.7.3` local build copied it into the wheel through
   broad package discovery, but the repo does not yet test or document that
   surface clearly. That is a public contract bug: users should know which
   imports and entrypoints are supported converter API, which are supported
   higher-level tool API, and which are private internals.

   Scope:

   - `pyproject.toml` package discovery
   - `src/svg2ooxml/__init__.py`, `src/svg2ooxml/public.py`
   - root `cli/` entrypoints
   - wheel-content tests for both converter library and top-level tool contents
   - docs that describe the supported package and tool surfaces

   Exit criteria:

   - wheel contents are intentional and tested, including whether
     `figma2gslides` ships in the same distribution or a separate one
   - public import tests define the supported converter API and supported
     tool API separately
   - release notes and README do not blur tool internals into converter API

2. **Central trust-boundary registry**

   Why: the recent fixes added safe relationship IDs, safe package paths,
   safe URL handling, and safe XML-fragment ingestion, but the rules still live
   near the call sites. Boundary behavior should be obvious, shared, and tested
   as a system.

   Scope:

   - URL and file-reference policy for SVG, image, font, and CSS resources
   - package path and relationship-ID generation
   - XML parser options and raw-fragment admission
   - size/decompression limits for embedded image/font/filter data
   - test fixtures for malicious and malformed inputs

   Exit criteria:

   - every external input crosses one named boundary helper before use
   - no production code calls an unsafe XML parser directly
   - no package writer accepts raw relationship IDs or package paths without
     normalization
   - malicious fixture tests cover SVG, font, image, PPTX packaging, and
     DrawingML fragment paths

3. **Style, cascade, and unit context**

   Why: many visual bugs look like rendering bugs but originate earlier in
   style resolution or unit context. This area is also where ad-hoc conversion
   logic tends to reappear after centralization.

   Scope:

   - `common/style/resolver.py`
   - parser style context and CSS inheritance
   - `core/resvg/usvg_tree.py`
   - `core/resvg/gradient_resolution.py`
   - `common/gradient_units.py`
   - conversion-context propagation into gradients, patterns, text, and filters

   Exit criteria:

   - one context object carries viewport, DPI, inherited style, and conversion
     units through parse -> IR -> render
   - tests cover `em`, `%`, nested SVG viewport, inherited paint, `currentColor`,
     and gradient/filter coordinate spaces
   - duplicate unit/color parsing paths are removed; do not reintroduce render
     package tree or paint parsers

4. **Filter, mask, raster, and EMF fallback seam**

   Why: filters and masks are where native DrawingML, raster assets, EMF
   fallbacks, bounds inflation, relationships, and alpha compositing meet. That
   seam has high visual impact and high packaging risk.

   Scope:

   - `filters/`, especially primitive composition and fallback metadata
   - `drawingml/filter_renderer.py`
   - `drawingml/mask_writer.py`
   - `drawingml/raster_adapter.py`
   - `drawingml/emf_adapter.py`
   - asset registration in `drawingml/pipelines/asset_pipeline.py`

   Exit criteria:

   - every fallback asset has a deterministic owner, bounds, content type, and
     relationship ID before DrawingML emission
   - mask/filter bounds are tested against SVG filter-region semantics
   - raster and EMF output have shared validation hooks
   - PowerPoint package validation is part of focused regression tests

5. **Animation fallback policy after bee-class regressions**

   Why: the bee work proved that group animation fidelity needs conservative,
   evidence-backed policy rather than optimistic synthesis. We should keep
   improving animation, but only after the package and trust boundaries are
   stable.

   Scope:

   - mixed animated groups
   - transform-origin and hinge/pivot semantics
   - compound transforms and sampled center motion
   - semi-group experiments where a `grpSp` preserves group layout while
     descendant animations remain independently targeted
   - generated fallback labels and metadata
   - openxml-audit capture evidence

   Current stance: bee-class assets still use the flatten/lower path. The
   original `grpSp` attempt broke the body apart when animated descendants were
   kept inside an animated group. The newer group-local coordinate work fixes
   render metadata localization, which raises a plausible future retry: preserve
   the group wrapper, but localize descendant animation payloads too. That retry
   must treat child rotate centers, scale centers, motion paths, and sampled
   center metadata as group-local before it can replace the current bee escape
   hatch.

   Exit criteria:

   - unsupported parent/child animation combinations degrade explicitly
   - transform-origin behavior is covered by focused visual or oracle tests
   - any semi-group path proves child animations remain visually attached to the
     grouped body under PowerPoint playback
   - animation fallback metadata says what was preserved and what was dropped
   - empirical claims point to openxml-audit evidence

6. **Test-suite maintainability**

   Why: several test files are now much larger than the production files they
   cover. Large tests slow review and hide duplicated fixtures, even when the
   production code is under the line cap.

   Scope:

   - `tests/unit/map/test_ir_converter.py`
   - `tests/unit/core/test_pptx_exporter_animation.py`
   - `tests/unit/drawingml/test_writer.py`
   - shared fixture builders for scenes, SVG snippets, PPTX packages, and
     filter assets

   Exit criteria:

   - large test files split by behavior area
   - fixtures live near the domain they serve
   - failure output stays local to one behavior seam
   - maintainability checks include production files first, test files second

Non-targets for this stream:

- Do not start a broad NumPy conversion pass until style/unit context is
  stable. NumPy should accelerate known-good math, not conceal unclear units.
- Do not expand PowerPoint research assets in this repo; empirical capture and
  oracle corpus work belongs in `openxml-audit` per ADR-033.
- Do not pursue new feature surface before public converter/tool package
  boundaries are enforceable.

Consequences:

- The next commit should likely address package discovery/public surface before
  deeper renderer work.
- Security and package-boundary bugs outrank visual-fidelity bugs when both are
  available.
- Large-file splitting remains useful, but only when it follows a behavior seam
  and comes with targeted tests.
- Each pass should leave behind a small regression suite for the seam it
  hardened, not only ad hoc bug tests.

### Road to 0.9: Measured Fidelity Release (ADR-036)

Status: accepted for the 0.9 release stream.

Context:

The 0.7.x stream split oversized modules, hardened packaging and optional
dependency boundaries, and centralized repeated conversion helpers. The 0.8.0
release made fidelity tiers, trace payloads, fallback metadata, and PPTX trace
embedding typed and explicit. The 0.8.1 patch then tightened typed CSS value
evaluation, calc handling, non-finite authored numeric parsing, and conversion
helper reuse across colors, gradients, filters, masks, transforms, text, and
animation values.

That means the next release should not be another broad architecture pass. The
converter now has enough policy, typed parsing, and tracing infrastructure to
choose work by measured user-visible fidelity.

The remaining risk is not that the converter cannot emit a PPTX. It is that
some legal, editable PPTX output still differs from the SVG/browser reference
in PowerPoint slideshow mode. The most important 0.9 work is therefore to rank
those differences, fix the highest-impact causes, and keep every degradation
local, explicit, and measurable.

Decision:

0.9 is a measured fidelity release. Its release story is:

> make PowerPoint output visibly closer to browser-rendered SVG, with ranked
> evidence and explicit fallback accounting.

Execution contract:

- `tools.visual.corpus_audit` is the converter-side 0.9 measurement aggregator.
  If it cannot express a needed converter metric, extend that tool and its tests
  before adding a parallel one-off report script.
- `openxml-audit` remains the authority for empirical PowerPoint behavior,
  authored control decks, oracle corpus evidence, and research lab tooling.
  PowerPoint-specific observations about authored or round-tripped XML promoted
  into 0.9 planning must cite `openxml-audit`; this repo should only consume
  those findings as emitter policy, test expectations, or compact release
  evidence.
- Local image/PPTX artefacts stay under ignored `reports/visual/...` paths.
  Release-relevant evidence is promoted as compact Markdown/JSON summaries
  under `docs/reference/telemetry/` only after the run is reproducible enough
  to compare before and after a fix.
- PowerPoint slideshow evidence is the release gate for PowerPoint-specific
  visual fidelity. Converter-side capture of svg2ooxml-generated decks may live
  here because it validates emitted output. Authored control decks, oracle
  extraction, and PowerPoint behavior discovery still belong in `openxml-audit`.
  LibreOffice/soffice rendering remains useful for cheap triage, build/open
  checks, and CI-friendly smoke tests, but it is not a substitute for
  PowerPoint slideshow evidence when a bug is PowerPoint-specific.
- A 0.9 fix must name the failing ranked row it addresses, the metric it
  improves, and the fallback or native path it changes.
- If a ranked failure is caused by a known DrawingML limitation, the fix is to
  make the fallback explicit, bounded, and traceable rather than pretending the
  native mapping is equivalent.

Baseline run shape:

- static PowerPoint pass:
  `python -m tools.visual.corpus_audit --renderer powerpoint --output reports/visual/powerpoint/audit/0.9-baseline --top 50`
- animation PowerPoint pass:
  `python -m tools.visual.corpus_audit --renderer powerpoint --check-animation --output reports/visual/powerpoint/audit/0.9-animation-baseline --top 50`
- tier spot checks:
  repeat the highest-ranked subset with `--fidelity-tier direct`, `mimic`,
  `emf`, and `bitmap` only where fallback policy is part of the decision
- CI-friendly triage pass:
  `python -m tools.visual.corpus_audit --renderer soffice --output reports/visual/audit/0.9-triage --top 50`

The exact input set can expand, but the first accepted baseline should include
the local W3C corpus, curated visual fixtures, and any local body/sample corpus
already wired through `tools.visual.corpus_sources`.

Report contract:

- per-case identity: SVG path, corpus name when known, artefact directory, and
  fidelity tier when one was forced
- pipeline health: build status, render/open status, browser render status,
  diff status, and error category
- visual metrics: SSIM or equivalent, pixel diff percentage, maximum bounding
  box delta, source/target count delta, and rasterized leaf count
- animation metrics: emitted/skipped native fragments, stable reason-code
  totals, frame count, minimum/average animation SSIM, and maximum animation
  pixel diff
- fallback accounting: typed fallback asset counts, geometry totals, trace
  stage totals, and any broadening of bitmap/EMF use
- priority score: a deterministic heuristic that ranks broken builds first,
  then PowerPoint render/open failures, slideshow animation mismatches, static
  visual mismatches, structure drift, and unexpected fallback growth

The score is a triage device, not a product metric. Before taking a fix, check
the actual artefacts and trace reason codes; after the fix, rerun enough of the
same report to prove the row moved or disappeared.

Target order:

1. **Ranked fidelity report first**

   Run larger W3C/static/animation/body passes against the 0.8 baseline and
   produce a single ranked report. The report must include build/open status,
   browser render status, PowerPoint slideshow render status, SSIM or equivalent
   similarity metric, max pixel diff, fallback counts by type, and skipped
   animation reason codes.

   Exit criteria:

   - a current top-offender list exists before implementation begins
   - report output is stable enough to compare before/after runs
   - each major 0.9 fix names the ranked failure it addresses

2. **Slideshow-first animation parity**

   Improve authored PowerPoint animation behavior where current output is legal
   but visually inert or wrong at slideshow time. Prioritize `mainSeq`,
   build-list, `grpId`, click/autoplay wiring, begin references, delay offsets,
   and effect-family mapping.

   Durable mapping preference:

   - scale pulse -> authored scale / Grow-Shrink style behavior
   - opacity pulse -> transparency emphasis behavior
   - discrete visibility -> `set` / discrete effect groups
   - path motion -> authored motion path when available
   - multi-keyframe color -> segmented effects rather than first/last collapse

   Exit criteria:

   - targeted animation control decks play in slideshow mode
   - pane-visible but inert timing regressions have focused tests
   - unsupported animation fragments emit stable reason codes

3. **Filter, lighting, and source-surface fidelity**

   Fix the static visual failures where current fallback or native mapping loses
   SVG source semantics. Prioritize `SourceGraphic`, `SourceAlpha`, filter input
   routing, diffuse/specular lighting composition, alpha masking, and smallest
   correct-unit raster fallback.

   Exit criteria:

   - filter and lighting tests cover actual shape geometry, not synthetic square
     placeholder surfaces
   - diffuse lighting is treated as an opaque light map and specular lighting as
     a non-opaque highlight map where the SVG primitive requires it
   - fallback assets remain typed, bounded, and traceable

4. **Typed CSS value and calc evaluation**

   `calc()` is not a standalone headline feature for 0.9, but it is a fidelity
   enabler for geometry, gradients, filters, stroke widths, and transforms. The
   current code resolves context-free and several contextual `calc()` values
   through a small typed evaluator. 0.9 should finish the property-context
   coverage that still affects ranked fidelity failures, rather than expanding
   CSS support as an abstract feature.

   Decision:

   - keep `tinycss2` as the CSS token source
   - keep SVG/PPTX-specific evaluation local to this repo
   - represent typed values explicitly: number, length, percentage,
     length-percentage, angle, and time
   - require an explicit resolution context carrying axis, viewport, object
     bounding box, font size, DPI, and fallback unit
   - leave values unresolved until the correct property context is available
   - do not silently coerce invalid `calc()` expressions to zero

   Exit criteria:

   - wrong-axis percentages cannot leak between x/y/filter/gradient contexts
   - `var()` resolution feeds typed calc evaluation without losing fallback or
     cycle semantics
   - README claims about `calc()` match the implemented support level

5. **Static fidelity cheap wins**

   Use the ranked report to decide order, but likely bounded wins include slide
   background detection/emission, viewBox stroke-width verification,
   `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke`, group opacity multiplication for
   non-overlapping children, and `<use>` / group fill inheritance audits.

   Exit criteria:

   - each fix has a focused fixture and before/after visual evidence
   - no fix broadens raster fallback without a trace reason

6. **Browser export integration gate**

   Finish end-to-end browser export workflow testing only to the extent needed
   to keep converter confidence. App-specific operational hardening remains
   subordinate to package/runtime fidelity unless it blocks the public converter
   contract.

   Exit criteria:

   - browser export smoke path is covered end to end
   - integration failures are fixed where they affect converter output or
     published package behavior

0.9 release gates:

- full unit suite
- full integration suite
- fast end-to-end suite
- local build and wheel metadata inspection
- W3C build/open gates remain green
- ranked browser-vs-PowerPoint report generated for the release candidate,
  with the command, input set, renderer, threshold, and environment noted
- top-offender list updated with what improved and what remains broken
- at least one before/after evidence note for each 0.9 headline fix
- no new base-install optional dependency leaks
- no broad fallback-rate increase without explicit reason-code accounting
- README feature claims checked against the measured support level

Non-targets for 0.9:

- no broad file-splitting or dedupe pass unless a ranked fidelity bug forces it
- no whole CSS layout engine dependency just to evaluate `calc()`
- no full `foreignObject`, full `@import`, or browser runtime emulation unless
  the ranked corpus proves it is a top blocker
- no expansion of empirical PowerPoint research assets in this repo; evidence
  still belongs in `openxml-audit` per ADR-033
- no public claim that a feature is "supported" when the implementation only
  validates XML or only works in a non-PowerPoint renderer

Consequences:

- the first 0.9 task is measurement, not another dedupe implementation pass
- fidelity fixes should be selected from the ranked report, not from whichever
  file looks large or messy
- typed CSS/calc work after 0.8.1 is justified only where it removes real
  context drift in geometry, gradients, filters, stroke widths, or transforms
- docs must stop overstating CSS support; README and release notes should
  distinguish supported typed contexts from unresolved or intentionally deferred
  CSS features
- report-generation code becomes part of the product quality surface; schema
  drift, unstable reason codes, and hidden optional dependency imports are
  release risks
- the first implementation slice after this ADR should harden
  `tools.visual.corpus_audit` output enough to produce the 0.9 baseline summary
  without manual spreadsheet work

### Corpus Feedback Loop for 0.9 Closure (ADR-037)

Status: accepted for the 0.9 release stream.

Context:

The W3C SVG 1.1 corpus is now local in this repository under the same
`tests/svg`, `tests/png`, and `tests/harness` tree. During the current corpus
feedback pass, several failures that looked like renderer regressions turned
out to be measurement or packaging issues:

- transparent W3C PNGs carried hidden black RGB, so naive RGB conversion made
  correct output look wrong
- simple SVG checkerboard patterns needed an actual transparent raster tile,
  not a DrawingML preset approximation
- filter lighting fallbacks could be visually acceptable while their embedded
  PNG alpha still exposed checkerboard in consumers that show transparency
- some high scores were caused by revision/footer drift or structure/raster
  accounting even when the relevant visual content was fixed

The risk is a loop of ad hoc fixes where every new W3C row creates a local
patch, but the release story never converges. 0.9 needs a repeatable feedback
loop that turns corpus failures into classified decisions.

Decision:

0.9 closure uses a ranked corpus-feedback loop, not a file-by-file migration
checklist.

Operating rules:

- Use the existing local W3C corpus mirror. Do not create a duplicate corpus or
  alternate fixture tree unless a source file is genuinely absent.
- Compare against the W3C PNGs where they exist, and against browser-rendered
  references where PNGs are missing or known stale.
- Normalize reference alpha before judging content. Transparent pixels must be
  composited over the same background as the generated slide image before RGB
  diffing.
- Work from the ranked top-offender window, usually top 40, and keep the run
  directory in `reports/visual/...` so every row has inspectable artefacts.
- For each target, decide one of four outcomes:
  - `fixed`: behavior changed and the ranked row improved or disappeared
  - `measurement-fixed`: audit/diff/reference handling changed and a false
    positive was removed
  - `accepted-limitation`: DrawingML or PowerPoint cannot represent the SVG
    behavior natively, so fallback metadata and bounds were made explicit
  - `deferred`: the row needs a broader subsystem change and is documented as
    such
- Add a focused regression test for every code fix. Visual evidence alone is
  not enough.
- Prefer narrow subsystem fixes over per-file overrides. A corpus row may be
  the trigger, but the patch should explain the SVG feature it fixes.
- Do not change SVG semantics only to improve a screenshot. If a visual problem
  is really a media-alpha, background-compositing, or audit-normalization issue,
  fix that boundary instead of altering filter, pattern, or geometry semantics.

Batch cadence:

- Run a single-case audit while investigating one row.
- After a fix, rerun the same single case and inspect the PPTX media, slide
  render, browser/reference image, and trace counters.
- After several fixes, rerun the current top-offender batch with the same
  command and compare ranked rows, not only pass/fail status.
- Promote only compact summaries to docs. Raw PPTX, PNG, and browser artefacts
  remain under ignored `reports/visual/...`.

Current target classes:

1. Reference/diff correctness: alpha normalization, stale PNG detection, and
   browser fallback when a W3C PNG is misleading.
2. Paint-server fidelity: patterns, gradients, inherited paint, `currentColor`,
   object-bounding-box vs user-space coordinates, and tile phase.
3. Filter fallback fidelity: source-surface rendering, `SourceGraphic` /
   `SourceAlpha`, filter-region bounds, lighting alpha/background behavior, and
   deterministic fallback asset registration.
4. Text and transform fallback routing: rotated `tspan`, dense text, and
   cases where PowerPoint-native text is worse than a bounded vector or bitmap
   fallback.
5. Structural SVG features: `<use>`, `<symbol>`, links, clipping/masking, and
   external image/resource resolution.

0.9 acceptance for corpus feedback:

- the release candidate has a reproducible ranked W3C report with command,
  renderer, threshold, environment, and input set recorded
- top-ranked failures are classified, not merely observed
- the top-offender batch shows no unexplained build/open failures
- fixed rows have focused tests and before/after audit directories
- fallback growth is accounted for by reason code and does not silently mask a
  native regression
- known limitations are explicit in metadata, docs, or issue notes instead of
  being hidden behind generic bitmap fallback

Consequences:

- "Next target" means the next ranked corpus row, not the next SVG file in
  lexical order.
- A high score is a triage pointer. It is not automatically a bug until the
  reference image, generated media, slide render, and trace metadata agree.
- Measurement fixes are first-class 0.9 work because they prevent us from
  optimizing against false failures.
- The corpus pass should leave the project with a durable ranked ledger of
  what was fixed, what was measured differently, what is knowingly deferred,
  and why.

## Text Rendering Strategy

### Three-Tier Text Pipeline
1. **Native DrawingML** (preferred) — editable text with FontForge→EOT font
   embedding. Used for uniform spacing (`spc`), uniform rotation (`xfrm rot`),
   writing-mode (`vert`), baselines, and standard text properties.
2. **WordArt `prstTxWarp`** — text on curves. Always used for `textPath`;
   default preset (`textArchUp`) when no classifier match. Keeps text editable.
3. **Glyph outlines via Skia** (last resort) — per-character custGeom shapes
   for non-uniform dx/dy/rotate. Vector quality, not editable. Skia Font
   objects cached by (family, size).

### Stroke Width Ownership

All DrawingML shape-line emission should flow through `stroke_to_xml()` so
stroke width, opacity, cap/join, dash, gradient, and pattern behavior stay in
one path. Per-character glyph outline text is a shape fallback, so it adapts
`Run.stroke_*` fields into the shared `Stroke` model before emission rather
than maintaining a separate text-only line-width serializer.

This does not merge every stroke-width defect into one class. Known separate
ingress points remain: resvg/DOM style-source drift for `<use>` clones,
marker scaling from `markerUnits="strokeWidth"`, transformed non-scaling
stroke policy, EMF/raster fallback stroke widths, and `stroke-width` animation
fallback. Those should be fixed at their source boundary, then still emit
through the shared DrawingML stroke serializer where the target is a shape.

### WordArt-First Policy
WordArt preferred over outlines for textPath: `prefer_native_wordart=True`,
lowered confidence threshold, fixed `prstTxWarp` schema (child element, not
attribute). Classifier relaxed for arch detection.

### Comprehensive OpenType Feature Support (ADR-030, proposed)

**Context.** svg2ooxml's stated goal is a comprehensive SVG→PPTX converter,
not an 80/20 tool. CSS (and therefore SVG 2 text) carries substantial
typography signals through `font-variant-caps`, `font-variant-numeric`,
`font-variant-ligatures`, `font-variant-position`, `font-variant-alternates`,
and the `font-feature-settings` escape hatch. PowerPoint's DrawingML text
schema exposes a few of these directly as run properties — `cap="small|all"`,
`baseline=` for sub/sup, `lang=` for locale-specific features, and GPOS
kerning survives automatically inside the EOT-wrapped font — but has no
runtime selector for the rest. For unmapped features, the rasteriser renders
whatever the font's default `cmap` points at, and dropping them silently is
a fidelity loss that compounds across editorial, data viz, and hand-authored
SVG inputs.

**Prior art in this repo.**

- `docs/reference/research/svg-to-drawingml-feature-map.md:320` — `font-variant:
  small-caps` is already implemented natively via `cap="small"` on
  `<a:rPr>`, validated against the .NET SDK. Small caps and all-small-caps
  are **not** candidates for baking because the native path is better:
  PowerPoint handles the cap synthesis itself with correct metrics.
- `docs/reference/research/svg-to-drawingml-feature-map.md:338–339` — `baseline-shift:
  super` / `baseline-shift: sub` already emit the `baseline` attribute on
  `<a:rPr>`, so `font-variant-position: sub|super` will share that path and
  also **not** need baking.
- `docs/reference/research/svg-to-drawingml-feature-map.md:363` — `xml:lang` / `lang`
  already flows to `<a:rPr lang="…"/>`, which triggers PowerPoint's
  locale-specific OT features (localised forms, required ligatures) at
  render time.
- `services/fonts/embedding.py:419–598` — `_select_ligature_glyphs` and
  `_glyph_ligature_sequences` already walk FontForge `getPosSub("*")`
  entries and keep `ligature`-kind glyphs through subsetting. This is
  subset-correctness, not baking: ligatures already reachable via the
  font's default `cmap` survive and render natively, so `liga` (common
  ligatures, enabled by default in most fonts) is **not** a baking target
  either.
- `docs/specs/FONT_EMBEDDING_ANALYSIS.md` +
  `FONT_INJECTION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` + `FONT_DATA_FLOW_VISUAL.txt` — a
  2025-11-03 exploration pass mapping the entire font-embedding data flow
  across five injection points (WebFontProvider → TextPipeline →
  EmbeddingEngine → DrawingMLWriter → PPTXPackageBuilder). Any work
  touching the embedding pipeline should read these first. Notably flags a
  "metadata flow gap" at `text_pipeline.py:233–248` where `FontMatch`
  metadata is not explicitly merged into `FontEmbeddingRequest` metadata.
- `docs/internals/pipeline-analysis.md:364–368` — Known-gap list
  explicitly calls out `font-feature-settings` and `font-variation-settings`
  as unsupported. The adjacent bullet claiming `font-variant` is "stored but
  not applied" is **stale**: the feature map confirms small-caps is applied.
  Correcting that bullet is a docs-drift follow-up, out of scope for this
  ADR.
- `docs/internals/webfont-provider.md:491–492` — `font-feature-settings`
  and `font-variation-settings` listed under "Future", confirming the gap
  this ADR addresses.

**Decision.** Support the unmapped OT features by **baking** them into
synthetic embedded font variants at conversion time, rather than waiting
for a DrawingML schema change that is not coming. For each unique
`(family, sorted(feature_tags))` combination reached during IR conversion,
produce a baked font whose `cmap` and `glyf` tables reflect the
substitutions the requested GSUB features would have performed, save it
under a deterministic synthetic family name, embed it as a separate EOT
part in the PPTX, and rewrite the affected DrawingML text runs to reference
the synthetic name via `<a:latin typeface="…"/>`.

**Scope — in.** GSUB-driven features with no native DrawingML path:
figure styles (`onum`/`lnum`/`tnum`/`pnum`), fractions (`frac`/`afrc`),
ordinals (`ordn`), slashed zero (`zero`), discretionary ligatures (`dlig`),
historical ligatures (`hlig`), contextual alternates (`calt`), stylistic
alternates (`salt`), stylistic sets (`ss01`–`ss20`), character variants
(`cv01`–`cv99`), titling caps (`titl`), unicase (`unic`), and the raw
`font-feature-settings` escape hatch for anything else a user writes
explicitly. The high-value real-world subset is figure styles (data viz
needs `tnum`, editorial typography wants `onum`), fractions, and stylistic
sets; everything else is long tail but cheap once the pipeline exists.

**Scope — out.** `font-variant-caps` (all values): native via `cap="none|
small|all"`, existing code path, do not touch. `font-variant-position: sub|
super`: native via `baseline=`, existing code path. Default-on ligatures
(`liga`, `rlig`, `clig`): render via the source font's `cmap` plus existing
subset-time preservation in `_select_ligature_glyphs`. Kerning (`kern` /
GPOS): survives inside the EOT-wrapped font and PowerPoint honours it at
render time. Locale-dependent features: triggered by `lang=` on `<a:rPr>`.
`font-variation-settings` and variable fonts generally: a separate code
path via `fontTools.varLib.instancer` producing static instances at the
requested axis values — handled in a future ADR, not this one.

**Preconditions.** The OTF (CFF) → TTF (`glyf`) converter at
`services/fonts/otf2ttf.py` is a hard prerequisite because baking operates on
`glyf` outlines, and any CFF-flavoured source font must be rebuilt in TT form
before the bake step. That converter landed in the same session as this ADR
and is already wired into the embedding engine.

**Implementation order.**

1. Port `glyph_baking.py` from tokenmoulds under
   `services/fonts/glyph_baking.py`: runs GSUB substitutions in-process via
   `fontTools.subset` / manual `cmap` rewriting, preserves horizontal metrics
   and line metrics so layout does not shift, returns baked bytes.
2. Introduce a `BakedFontRegistry` keyed on `(family, frozenset(feature_tags))`
   with memoisation so each unique combination is baked at most once per
   conversion. Deterministic synthetic naming: `"<family> [<tag>,<tag>]"` with
   tags sorted, truncated and hash-suffixed if the PPTX font-name length
   budget is exceeded.
3. Extend `core/styling/style_extractor.py` to parse only the
   `font-variant-*` properties whose feature tags are in the baking scope
   (numeric, ligatures excluding `liga`, alternates, East Asian), plus the
   raw `font-feature-settings` escape hatch. `font-variant-caps`,
   `font-variant-position`, and the default-on ligature classes continue
   to flow through their existing native DrawingML paths and must **not**
   be routed into the baking registry. Normalise each text run to a
   canonical sorted tuple of OT feature tags so identical requests
   collapse on lookup.
4. Thread the registry through `core/ir/text_converter.py` and
   `drawingml/writer.py`: text runs gain a resolved `typeface` property that
   may differ from the source `font-family` when a baked variant is needed,
   and the DrawingML text renderer emits `<a:latin typeface="…"/>`
   accordingly.
5. Extend `FontEmbeddingEngine` so baked variants flow through the same EOT
   packaging path as regular embedded fonts, each with their own relationship
   and content-type entry.
6. Specimen corpus under `tests/corpus/font_variants/` with one SVG per
   feature value. Each test asserts that the generated PPTX contains the
   expected baked family, that the expected text run references it, and that
   the OpenXML audit still passes.

**Trade-offs.** PPTX size grows roughly linearly with the number of distinct
feature combinations used in the input SVG — the common case is one or two
baked variants per family. Baking adds fontTools work at conversion time,
but the registry makes it O(unique combinations) rather than O(text runs).
Synthetic family names are visible to PowerPoint users if they click into
the font picker, which is ugly but acceptable for fidelity wins.

**Interaction with the large-file refactor.** `style_extractor.py` (1130 LOC)
and `text_converter.py` (1309 LOC) are both on the split list in
`docs/specs/refactor-large-files.md`. Font-variant parsing should land on top
of the split, not underneath it: either wait for those PRs, or extract the
font-variant parsing into a new self-contained module under
`core/styling/paint/` that the refactor can integrate without rewriting.

**Open questions.**

- Cap on baked variants per family before we warn and degrade to the
  unbaked default? Proposal: soft limit of 8, logged at INFO level.
- Behaviour when the source font lacks a requested GSUB feature (e.g.
  `small-caps` on a font with no `smcp` lookup)? Proposal: log at DEBUG,
  fall through to the default cmap, do not synthesise small caps from
  scaled capitals.
- Should `font-variant-alternates: styleset(3)` produce a baked variant per
  invoked `ssNN` tag, or group them? Proposal: group, because real-world
  usage combines stylistic sets with other features.
- How to surface baking failures (corrupt source font, unsupported feature)
  without aborting the whole conversion? Proposal: per-run fallback plus a
  diagnostic in the asset registry, following the pattern already used for
  filter and mask fallbacks.

## Quality & Testing

### Eliminate String-Parse-Graft XML (ADR-021)
All XML-generating functions return lxml elements instead of strings.
`graft_xml_fragment()` helper as transitional bridge. Covers gradients, paint,
paths, filters, masks.

### Centralize Unit Conversions (ADR-022)
Consolidates scattered `× 60000` (angle), `× 100000` (opacity/scale), and EMU
conversions into `common/conversions/` utilities. Eliminates magic numbers and
inconsistent rounding.

### OOXML Schema Compliance (ADR-023, completed)
97 pre-existing schema violations fixed: headEnd/tailEnd ordering, filter bugs,
non-standard clipPath/mask elements. PowerPoint repairs eliminated. PPTX passes
OpenXML audit.

### Batch Performance (ADR-024)
Streaming build (O(1) memory), slide-level cache (warm re-runs ~95% faster),
parallel rendering (8-core ~4-6× speedup). Targets 2-3 min → 30-45s cold,
3-5s warm.

### Quality Roadmap (ADR-025, completed)
Deterministic W3C sampling + OpenXML audit gating in CI. Resvg-only default
path active. Filter/font hardening complete. Docker ergonomics ready.

### Dependency Footprint (ADR-026)
Dependency tiers: base converter avoids NumPy; NumPy/skia-python live behind
render/color/accel extras, FontForge is optional, and LibreOffice + OpenXML
audit are test-only. Python 3.13 single runtime. Docker-compatible container
lane for full-stack/render development.

### PresentationML-First PowerPoint Oracle Strategy (ADR-029)
The product target is PresentationML, not a version-matrix of PowerPoint
behaviors. Primary correctness comes from spec-valid, semantically coherent
PresentationML plus validator coverage (`openxml-audit` and repo semantic
checks). PowerPoint remains an important runtime and oracle, but only for
high-risk constructs where ECMA and Microsoft docs do not fully determine
working emitted structures in practice: triggers, `interactiveSeq`, build-list
coupling, pane-sensitive effect wrappers, and other obscure animation cases.

For those cases, the durable research source of truth is XML-first:

1. saved PowerPoint-authored raw slide XML
2. extracted raw `p:timing` / `p:bldLst`
3. normalized XML and signatures for mining
4. human notes

Working `.pptx` decks are temporary authoring inputs, not the long-term oracle.
Compatibility policy stays intentionally small:

- keep one latest-PowerPoint smoke lane for slideshow/open/roundtrip checks
- avoid per-version support matrices unless a concrete regression demands it
- collapse proven oracle findings into emitter templates and validator rules

This keeps the architecture centered on `svg -> PresentationML` while still
using PowerPoint where it is the only practical oracle for emitted animation
structures.

## Infrastructure

### EU-Sovereign Self-Hosted Stack (ADR-038)

Replaces the retired GCP deployment (ADR-014/015/016, project deleted
2026-01-16). All hosting and SaaS dependencies must be EU-jurisdiction to
satisfy a data-sovereignty / CLOUD Act avoidance policy.

**Stack:**
- **Compute**: Hetzner Cloud (DE/FI), running Coolify as the PaaS layer.
  svg2ooxml ships as a Dockerized HTTP API; lxml works unchanged in-container.
- **Source & CI**: Forgejo self-hosted on a Hetzner box. Forgejo Actions builds
  the image; webhook into Coolify triggers redeploy. Data volume backed up via
  restic to a second Hetzner box / Storage Box.
- **CDN / edge**: Gcore (LU). Terminates TLS at edge, origin-pulls to Coolify
  with origin shielding enabled. Cache policy: no-cache on `POST /convert`;
  content-addressed GETs are cacheable.
- **Certs**: ZeroSSL (AT) via ACME, replacing Let's Encrypt (ISRG/US). Edge cert
  managed in Gcore; origin can use a pinned long-lived cert or skip origin
  verification entirely.
- **Origin lockdown**: Hetzner firewall allowlists Gcore origin-pull IP ranges;
  Coolify's Traefik additionally requires an `X-Origin-Auth` shared-secret
  header injected by Gcore, preventing direct-to-origin bypass.

**Rejected alternatives** (all US-jurisdiction): Fly.io, Cloud Run, Vercel, AWS,
Cloudflare, GitHub-as-source, Let's Encrypt.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Self-hosting trades managed-service convenience for jurisdiction control: we
  own patching, backups, and the single-VPS failure mode. Mitigated by
  snapshots, restic backups, and the option of a second Hetzner box for warm
  failover when traffic justifies it.
- No global edge from origin — Gcore's PoPs handle that.
- Prior Cloud Run bill (~$30/mo, paying for warm min-instances) replaced by
  ~€5/mo Hetzner compute + Gcore (volume-quoted) + ZeroSSL (free tier).
